> The old age Telephone game. But with pictures. On your phone.

When you were young you probably played the game of Telephone where a word gets passed from person to person and ends up distorted usually.
A friend recently introduced me to a version where you draw the word instead of just saying it. But since you need paper you usually can't play it when you actually need it.
Therefore I spent some time to create a web version that anyone can use to play!

## Rules of the game


The game is simple:
* Get everyone in a circle
* Every player a phone and sets the same number of passes.
* Press start and choose a starting word.
* Pass the phone to the next person in the circle
* Draw the word that you see and press Done
* Pass the phone to the next person in the circle
* Guess what the previous person drew 
* Pass the phone
* ....
* Once the number of passes has been completed you will see the total progression and can even save it!
